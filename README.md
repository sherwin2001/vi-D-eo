## A blockchain based Video viewing and Storage Decentralized Application.  
This application decentralizes the process of storing and retrieving Videos on a single, centralized server (like Youtube, Vimeo or Google Drive).  

Instead of a typical client-server application where the user requests the server through client for retrieving or storing the videos, this application makes the use of BlockChain and Smart Contracts to store the videos as tokens.  

This reduces the dependency on Internet as well as makes it more secure compared to Client-Server application because no one can access or store the videos except the owner of the BlockChain account.  

The project can be slightly modified and used as well for the storage of sensitive data and information like documents, images, files, etc. making it to be used on a vast and commercial scale instead of just storing and retrieving a particular type of data.  

Private Organizations can highly benefit from this type of storage method due to the efficiency and security of the stored data.
